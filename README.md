# Star-Pattern
Day 3 of my coding challenge focuses on implementing various star (*) patterns using nested loops in C++. This challenge helped me strengthen my understanding of loop control, conditional logic, and pattern visualization.
Patterns Implemented:-
Inverted Right Triangle
Right Triangle
Square Pattern
Right-Aligned Triangle
Reverse Right-Aligned Triangle
Each pattern demonstrates a different way of controlling rows, columns, and spacing.
